# Woodwright window and sash restoration

## The following project was created for my client Woodwright window and sash restoration.

### Introduction:

My client has requested I create a simple static website that can be used to advertise and market my client's new window and sash restoration company.

This project is very simple in nature as it's purpose is to act as a simple landing page where potential clients can find the business online, read testimonials and be prompted to contact the company.

### Project specifications:

As of writing this, (22/June/2023), the following outlines the structure of the project. This document will clarify the structure of the website and serve as a means of measuring progress.

1. Landing page: The landing page will have a sleek, minimalist design. Competitors in the space (lambstongue.ie) have very noisy, complex websites that may confuse and distract prospective customers. The purpose of this landing page is to direct the customers attention toward taking action.

Desired actions include:

    a. Contacting the company for a quote or expression of interest 
    b. Reading testimonials
    c. Learning about company projects

The landing page will have a very prominent phone number.

2. Testimonial page: The purpose of this page is to assure prospective customers that the company is capable of delivering a quality service, on time and with clear communication right throughout the project's delivery.

3. Project page: This will feature previous work along with client testimonials.
